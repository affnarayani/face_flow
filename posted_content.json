    "title": "Food Safety or Competition Issue? CCI Draws the Line in Maggi Sauce Case",
    "description": "<p>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) dismissed a complaint against Nestle India Limited concerning alleged use of contaminated water in the production of Maggi Sauce at its Goa factory. The complaint, filed by Sarvesh M. Kolumbkar, accused Nestle of violating the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and abusing its dominant position under Section 4 of the Competition Act. The informant sought an investigation into a purported \"Maggi Sauce scam\" and requested interim relief.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI found no prima facie contravention of the Competition Act, clarifying that the allegations centered on food safety, hygiene, and product labelling, issues under the jurisdiction of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The Commission emphasized that the alleged use of dirty water and mislabelling did not constitute anti-competitive practices or demonstrate that Nestle exploited its market position to restrict competitors or harm consumers.</p>\n\n<p>The decision reinforces that unethical business practices do not automatically equate to abuse of dominance unless they directly impact market competition. The CCI underscored its role in ensuring market fairness and efficiency, distinct from addressing general consumer grievances or regulatory non-compliance related to food safety. The order clarifies the boundary between competition law and sectoral regulation, directing concerns regarding public health, product contamination, or deceptive labelling to appropriate authorities like the FSSAI.</p>",

    "title": "Arbitral Award Must Be Within the Parameters of the Agreement Between the Parties",
    "description": "<p>Arbitration is rooted in party autonomy, where consent forms the basis of the tribunal's jurisdiction, scope, and authority. An arbitral award must adhere to the contract's parameters; deviations, either by disregarding terms or granting inconsistent relief, undermine the agreement's sanctity and the tribunal's jurisdiction, making the award vulnerable under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The Indian arbitration framework, particularly Section 28(3) of the Act, emphasizes contractual sanctity, mandating tribunals to decide per the contract's terms. Arbitrators interpret, but do not rewrite, contracts based on equity or fairness. The Supreme Court of India has consistently reinforced that tribunals are creations of the contract, unable to exceed their mandate. Awards violating express terms are deemed patently illegal and against public policy.</p>\n\n<p>Evidentiary discipline and procedural adherence are crucial, especially concerning contractual preconditions like notices or written approvals. Tribunals cannot waive these stipulations unless permitted by the contract. The Supreme Court has reinforced that commercial fairness cannot override contractual discipline, as seen in SEPCO Electric Power Construction Corporation vs. GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd., where the court set aside a tribunal's decision for wrongly invoking equitable estoppel to overlook mandatory contractual notices.</p>\n\n<p>Judicial review under Sections 34 and 37 serves as a safeguard against arbitral excess, intervening when awards exhibit patent illegality or violate public policy, ensuring arbitration remains true to party consent. Contracting parties must draft precisely and adhere to performance requirements. Courts assess whether awards respect the agreement's boundaries, exercising restraint when faithful interpretations exist and correcting departures.</p>\n\n<p>Arbitration's strength lies in predictability and respect for autonomy. Tribunals upholding the agreement's integrity reinforce commercial certainty. Conversely, exceeding mandates undermines the process. Awards must be rooted in the contract, ensuring arbitration remains an extension of party autonomy governed by the rule of contract.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) addressed a case filed by M/s C.C.L. Optoelectronics Private Ltd. against Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL), alleging abuse of dominant position under Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002. The informant contested BSNL's disqualification of its bid for a tender concerning Splice Closures for Optical Fiber Cables, arguing that the tender conditions were discriminatory and favored certain bidders.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI, upon examination, defined the relevant market as Telecommunication Services in India. It found that BSNL's market share (approximately 2.09%) was significantly smaller than those of its major competitors, such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The commission concluded that BSNL did not hold a dominant position. It also noted that the disqualification was based on past performance criteria, not turnover.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the CCI determined that no prima facie case of contravention of Section 4 of the Act was established against BSNL. The Commission closed the matter under Section 26(2) of the Competition Act, 2002, dismissing the application for interim relief and concluding that BSNL's actions did not constitute abuse of dominance or restrictive trade practices.</p>",

This draft aims to establish a unified, principle-based framework for transactions between regulated entities (REs) and their related parties, an area of long-standing concern regarding governance and prudential oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, regulations on lending to related parties are fragmented across various regulatory frameworks, leading to potential arbitrage and ambiguity. The new draft directions intend to harmonize governance standards, enhance transparency in related-party exposures, and strengthen market discipline across all REs, including banks, NBFCs, and cooperative banks.</p>\n\n<p>Key provisions include a broad definition of \"related parties\" aligned with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS 24), materiality-based thresholds for Board or committee approval of transactions, and a principle-based exemption to Section 20(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The draft also mandates comprehensive reporting and disclosure obligations to align with international best practices.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed framework emphasizes ethical governance and conflict of interest management, requiring financial institutions to embed robust governance and risk management practices. Non-compliance may lead to regulatory action and reputational consequences. This initiative, part of broader reforms promoting uniformity and sound corporate governance, follows the Final Co-Lending Framework. The RBI invites stakeholder feedback before finalizing the directions, which will supersede existing circulars.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Draft Lending to Related Parties Directions, 2025, represent a crucial step toward promoting integrity, transparency, and uniform governance in India's financial system, balancing operational flexibility with prudential discipline to enhance resilience and credibility.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench, in Parvati Swati v. Vyankat & Anr., reaffirmed a mother's right to custody following the father's death, emphasizing the paramount importance of the child's welfare under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. The ruling underscores that while grandparents can provide love, the mother, as the natural guardian, holds the inherent right and responsibility unless proven unfit.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose after the father's death, where the paternal grandparents sought guardianship of the minor child, whose custody had been granted to the father in a prior divorce decree. The mother filed a counter-application seeking custody, which was initially rejected. The High Court addressed whether the grandparents could claim custody in preference to the mother, citing Section 6(a) of the Act, which favors the mother as the natural guardian after the father's death, especially for children below five.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered arguments from both sides, including the mother's improved financial stability and the child's established relationship with the grandparents. Justice Chapalgaonkar, reiterating the child's welfare as paramount, ruled in favor of the mother, citing precedents that a natural parent's custody should only be denied if they are demonstrably unfit. The Court granted custody to the mother while providing visitation rights to the grandparents, balancing the child's legal right to maternal care with the importance of maintaining family bonds. This judgment reaffirms the principle that a mother's care is irreplaceable while emphasizing the need for compassion and justice in guardianship law.</p>",

This ruling sets a precedent in India's jurisprudence on deepfakes, AI exploitation, and publicity rights by acknowledging the legal protection of a celebrity's persona, extending to voice cloning, AI-generated content, and digital merchandise.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from the misappropriation of Asha Bhosle's voice, name, image, and likeness without her consent. AI platforms were developing tools to clone her voice, allowing users to generate songs in her style, which were then circulated on platforms like YouTube. Additionally, online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart were selling unauthorized merchandise featuring her image. Bhosle argued these actions violated her personality rights and moral rights under Section 38-B of the Copyright Act, 1957.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court concluded that Bhosle had established a strong prima facie case, emphasizing the unauthorized technological exploitation of her identity and reputation. The court issued ad-interim injunctions, restraining the defendants from misusing her personality attributes.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment significantly shapes India's response to AI, deepfakes, and personality rights. It affirms that a celebrity's voice, name, and likeness are protectable attributes, and AI voice cloning without consent constitutes infringement. The ruling also places a duty on intermediaries like Amazon, Flipkart, and YouTube to remove infringing content and share violator details, strengthening accountability in the digital ecosystem. While this judgment provides immediate relief, it also exposes the regulatory vacuum in India regarding AI-generated content and digital impersonation, highlighting the need for comprehensive legislation on digital identity and AI misuse.</p>",

It has become increasingly important for India's economic growth as the country develops essential infrastructure. The project financing ecosystem in India consists of equity, debt, and government support mechanisms and is underpinned by both public and private sector investment, as well as growing institutional support.</p>\n\n<p>Project finance is widely used across multiple infrastructure sectors in India. However, despite its growth, this ecosystem faces several persistent and emerging challenges, including those related to the legal and regulatory framework.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends emphasize the need to strengthen project preparation, enhance risk-sharing mechanisms, deepen bond markets, promote dispute resolution reforms, and leverage innovative financing tools like InvITs, ESG bonds, and blended finance. As India aims for a $5 trillion economy, robust project finance mechanisms will be vital for mobilizing the necessary capital for sustainable infrastructure development.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court addressed petitions concerning the difficulties visually impaired individuals face in identifying Indian currency notes, particularly the ₹50 denomination introduced post-demonetization. The court emphasized that accessibility is a constitutional and statutory mandate under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), requiring the State to ensure equal access to financial infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The petitions arose after the 2016 demonetization, as the reduced size variations in the new Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series notes made tactile identification challenging. The court formed a High-Powered Committee, led by Prof. M. Balakrishnan of IIT Delhi, to investigate and provide recommendations. The Committee highlighted the inadequacy of existing tactile features and proposed increased size variations, improved color contrasts, and durable materials. It also acknowledged the limitations of the MANI App and stressed the importance of accessibility in the Digital Rupee.</p>\n\n<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) responded that the current confusion was due to the concurrent circulation of old and new notes and argued that redesigning notes is a complex and costly process. The RBI also emphasized existing accessibility features and ongoing improvements to the MANI App, as well as plans to ensure Digital Rupee accessibility. The court acknowledged the hardships faced by visually impaired individuals and RBI's concerns, directing that accessibility recommendations be incorporated into the next series of banknotes and mandating banks to submit bi-annual progress reports on digital accessibility compliance. The judgment underscores that while policy discretion rests with the RBI and the government, it is constrained by the constitutional obligation of accessibility. The author concludes that the ruling represents judicial pragmatism, balancing economic feasibility with constitutional rights and establishing a pathway for a more inclusive financial future.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has ruled that Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) contributions collected by an employer do not become the property of the corporate debtor and must be excluded from the liquidation estate. This decision, delivered on September 24, 2025, in Company Appeal (AT)(Ins) No. 301 of 2024, overturns a prior NCLT order and directs that Rs 1,20,80,940 of ESI dues belonging to Gupta Dyeing & Printing Mills Pvt. Ltd. be kept separate from the assets available to other creditors during liquidation.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when the Regional Director of ESIC claimed that unpaid ESI contributions, deducted from workers' wages, should be excluded from the company's assets due to a statutory trust under Section 40(4) of the ESI Act, 1948. This claim was challenged by the liquidator and other creditors who would benefit from including the amount in the liquidation estate. The NCLT initially dismissed the ESIC plea, deeming the Corporation an operational creditor without priority under Section 53(1)(b) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>\n\n<p>On appeal, the NCLAT emphasized that employers hold employee ESI contributions as trustees for the ESIC, making non-payment a breach of trust. The tribunal aligned with a previous ruling in Nurani Subramanian Suryanarayanan, Liquidator of M/s Care IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd. v. ESIC, which resolved a similar issue in favor of the Corporation. The NCLAT clarified that Section 36(4)(a)(i) of the IBC carves out \"assets in trust for any third party\" from the liquidation estate, and Section 40(4) of the ESI Act creates precisely such a trust.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT set aside the NCLT order, directing that the ESI dues of Rs 1,20,80,940 be remitted to the ESIC and not treated as part of the liquidation estate. The ruling affirms that social security deductions are distinct and do not merge into the corporate debtor's assets. This decision serves as a reminder to liquidators and reinforces the right of statutory authorities to insist on exclusion rather than mere priority of such deductions. This precedent may influence similar claims related to other wage-related statutes like provident fund and gratuity.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In September 2025, the Delhi High Court concluded a protracted matrimonial dispute originating from a 2006 divorce petition filed in Mumbai. The central issues revolved around the wife's entitlement to half of a ₹1.09 crore surplus from an auctioned flat, the appropriateness of ₹2 lakh monthly interim maintenance, and the husband's plea for divorce based on cruelty and desertion. The court's 35-page judgment upheld established family law principles and underscored the continued relevance of fault in Hindu matrimonial law.</p>\n\n<p>The couple married in 1999 and lived in Mumbai due to the husband's job. After the husband left in 2006, the wife moved to Delhi. The husband filed for divorce, which was transferred to Delhi, triggering parallel litigation over maintenance and property rights. A flat purchased jointly during the marriage was auctioned due to default, resulting in the surplus now in dispute. The wife claimed entitlement to half the surplus and contested the interim maintenance amount, while the husband sought to overturn both.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court addressed four appeals collectively. The husband alleged cruelty and desertion based on various incidents, while the wife countered with claims of the husband's relationship with a colleague. The court considered several legal precedents regarding maintenance, cruelty, desertion, and the bar created by Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA). It also invoked the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act.</p>\n\n<p>The court affirmed the ₹2 lakh monthly maintenance, citing the wife's lack of independent income and the husband's financial capacity. It ruled that the wife was entitled to 50% of the flat's surplus, emphasizing that jointly-owned property is presumed to be held equally unless proven otherwise, and that the Benami Act prevents the husband from claiming sole ownership based on EMI payments. On the divorce petition, the court concurred with the Family Court that the husband did not demonstrate adequate cause for divorce, and the husband's own misconduct barred him from obtaining a decree. The court directed the release of ₹54.5 lakh to the wife, maintained the maintenance amount, and dismissed the divorce appeal, highlighting the importance of fault and clean hands in Indian matrimonial law and reminding litigants that conduct during and after filing for divorce is relevant.</p>",

This notification clarifies the existing provision in the Maharashtra Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 2017, Section 16(1)(b), that allows businesses to operate seven days a week, provided each employee receives a continuous 24-hour weekly rest period.

Custodians must maintain this net worth independently of other capital adequacy requirements. The scope of permissible activities is broadened, excluding banking companies and their affiliates. A new regulation mandates robust risk management frameworks, cybersecurity protocols, and business continuity plans.</p>\n\n<p>The code of conduct has been expanded to include 26 obligations.

The case involved parents who, after their son's death in a workplace accident, received Rs 10 lakh through a Lok Adalat settlement and later sought additional compensation from the Employees’ Compensation Commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>The Commissioner denied the claim, citing the prior Lok Adalat award as a final discharge of liability. The parents appealed this decision, leading the High Court to formulate two substantial questions of law: whether the Employees’ Compensation Act claim can be settled through a Pre-Litigation Petition despite Section 8(1) of the EC Act, and whether receipt of money from the Lok Adalat bars a subsequent claim for the statutory amount before the Commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>The Court, referencing the supremacy clause in Section 25 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, ruled that the Lok Adalat settlement was final. It reasoned that when a dispute is taken to a Permanent Lok Adalat, the restrictions of Section 8(1) are relaxed, given the Adalat's role in protecting weaker parties. The court also invoked the doctrine of election of remedies, stating that the parents, having chosen to settle at the Lok Adalat, were bound by that choice. Thus, the appeal was dismissed, affirming that the Rs 10 lakh already received constituted a full and conclusive settlement, preventing the family from pursuing further compensation through the Employees’ Compensation Commissioner.</p>",

The Court upheld medical expenses amounting to Rs. 20 lakhs, recognizing the necessity of the treatments for sustaining the victim's life.</p>\n\n<p>Critically, the Court rejected the lower courts' reliance on minimum wage as the basis for calculating loss of income. The Supreme Court deemed the use of minimum wage inappropriate for a graduate student pursuing a Chartered Accountancy qualification. Instead, it estimated a notional monthly income of Rs. 5,000 in 2001, considering his potential as an accountant, and applied a 40% increase for future prospects, consistent with National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi and Others. This led to a revised loss of income calculation of Rs. 15,12,000.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's judgment resulted in a significantly enhanced total compensation award of Rs. 40,34,356. The Court underscored the importance of considering a student's potential when determining compensation and reiterated that insurance companies cannot evade liability on unsubstantiated grounds, especially when life-saving medical care is involved. The ruling serves as a precedent for equitable compensation, acknowledging both the victim's potential and the substantial costs associated with life-sustaining care.</p>",

    "title": "Reshaping Professional Services: MCA Issues Consultation on Multi-Disciplinary Partnerships",
    "description": "<p>The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) launched a public consultation on September 17, 2025, regarding the proposed establishment of Multi-Disciplinary Partnership (MDP) firms in India. This initiative seeks to create a regulatory framework that enables domestic professional services firms (e.g., law, accounting, consulting) to compete effectively with larger international networks by allowing collaboration across disciplines while maintaining professional independence. Stakeholders are invited to submit their feedback by September 30, 2025, via the MCA’s e-Consultation Module or email.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Indian professional services firms operate within a fragmented regulatory environment, constrained by multiple professional statutes and licensing requirements that restrict cross-disciplinary collaboration. Recognizing that these structural challenges impede growth and competitiveness, the MCA is exploring MDPs as a solution, drawing on global best practices.</p>\n\n<p>The consultation, initiated through Notification No. 01/5/2025-PI/MCA, invites stakeholder views on various aspects of MDPs, including governance models, accountability, and transitional arrangements. This consultation presents an opportunity to shape the future of the professional services sector in India. If implemented effectively, MDPs could enhance efficiency, foster competition, and elevate Indian firms on the global stage. Stakeholder feedback is crucial in shaping a robust and forward-looking framework for multidisciplinary firms in India.</p>",

    "title": "PVR Wins Consumer Case: Restriction on Outside Snacks Upheld, Free Water Mandated",
    "description": "<p>The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Ernakulam, dismissed a consumer complaint against PVR Cinemas regarding its policy of prohibiting outside food and beverages. The complainant argued that this restriction constituted an unfair trade practice, forcing consumers to purchase overpriced in-house items.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission ruled that cinema theaters have the legal right to regulate entry conditions, including restricting outside food, referencing the Supreme Court precedent set in K.C. Cinema v. State of J&K. This right is contingent upon ensuring free access to drinking water and accommodating special needs. The complainant failed to prove a deficiency in service, as the ban on outside food was consistent with established legal precedent.</p>\n\n<p>While dismissing the complaint, the Commission issued a binding directive, ordering PVR Cinemas to strictly comply with its undertaking to provide uninterrupted access to free RO-filtered drinking water for all customers. This includes maintaining the facility hygienically and displaying prominent signage. This decision balances the operational rights of the multiplex with the fundamental health and welfare of consumers, mitigating potential exploitative practices.</p>",

    "title": "RBI Issues Directions on Settlement of Claims for Deceased Customers",
    "description": "<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the Reserve Bank of India (Settlement of Claims in respect of Deceased Customers of Banks) Directions, 2025, effective March 31, 2026. These directions consolidate and standardize procedures for settling claims related to deposit accounts, safe deposit lockers, and articles in safe custody for deceased bank customers, aiming to minimize delays and ensure uniform practices across commercial and cooperative banks. They do not apply to government-administered savings schemes like PPF or SCSS.</p>\n\n<p>The legal basis for these directions rests on provisions intended to expedite claim settlements. The RBI observed inconsistent bank practices regarding nomination, often requiring succession certificates even with existing nominations. These directions repeal prior circulars, establishing a uniform and enforceable system.</p>\n\n<p>For claims exceeding a specified threshold, settlement necessitates succession certificates, legal heir certificates, or affidavits, potentially with sureties. Banks retain discretion to act on uncontested Wills without requiring probate but require court orders for disputed claims. In the absence of a nomination, a simplified procedure involves claim forms, death certificates, identity proof, and a legal heir certificate or affidavit with no-objection statements from other heirs. Disputed cases without nomination require probate, succession certificate, or a court order for resolution.</p>\n\n<p>These Directions represent a significant reform in banking consumer protection law, establishing uniform procedures, timelines, and penalties for delays. They address long-standing grievances by depositor families, ensuring efficient access to funds and belongings while balancing ease of settlement with safeguards against wrongful claims. The harmonized framework enhances operational clarity for banks and strengthens customer trust in the banking system.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court Restores CCI Penalties on Film Exhibitors’ Federation for Anti-Competitive Conduct",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) appeal, reinstating its order against the Kerala Film Exhibitors Federation (KFEF) for anti-competitive conduct under Section 3 of the Competition Act. The court ruled that the CCI's initial notice, forwarding the Director General's (DG) report and inviting replies and a hearing, adequately complied with the Act. It held that a separate show-cause notice dedicated solely to the penalty was not required under the statutory scheme.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a complaint alleging KFEF organized a boycott preventing distributors from dealing with a specific theater. The CCI, based on the DG's report, found KFEF in violation and imposed monetary penalties and behavioral directions on the federation and its office-bearers. The COMPAT (Competition Appellate Tribunal) upheld the violation finding but overturned penalties against the office-bearers, arguing the lack of a separate penalty notice.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court addressed whether a second, separate show-cause notice specifically proposing penalties is required before imposing sanctions under the Act. The Court emphasized that the Competition Act necessitates timely and effective adjudication, with a single hearing offering a full opportunity to address both findings and potential sanctions. The Court found that the initial notice sufficiently identified the contraventions, named the individuals involved, sought financial information, and scheduled a hearing, satisfying the requirements of natural justice. Furthermore, the Court highlighted that Section 48 of the Act deems individuals in charge responsible for contraventions, negating the need for separate notification of liability. The Supreme Court restored the CCI's original order in full, also noting the importance of the DG report stage and the need to address all factual and mitigation points at that hearing.</p>",
